# Two_dimensional_transfer_matrix_for_Expansion_Chamber_Mufflers
MATLAB codes for computing the dispersion diagram, transmission loss and forced response for a single and periodic expansion chamber muffler system.

The main code is "PeriodicCM_2D.m" where the silencer data is loaded from "Data_Silencer.m" file. The rest of matlab codes are auxiliar function to compute the eigenroots, the eigenvectors, the transfer matrix, the forced response by using the Wave Expansion technique and the transmission loss coefficient. 

Please, feel free to suggest changes and to improve the code.
Enjoy!
